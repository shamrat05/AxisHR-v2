Onboarding And Offboarding That Protects Experience And Control</h2><p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> First impressions influence retention, and exit workflows influence risk. Both processes require coordination across HR, IT, finance, and managers.</p><p><strong>The Operational Job:</strong> Automate and standardize onboarding and offboarding workflows without losing accountability.</p><h3>The Operational Challenge</h3><p>Manual onboarding creates missed tasks, delayed access, and inconsistent documentation. Manual offboarding increases risk around assets, access revocation, and final settlement accuracy.</p><h3>How AxisHR Resolves It</h3><p>AxisHR provides reusable templates and packet workflows that assign tasks, track completion, and preserve evidence at every step.</p></div></section>
