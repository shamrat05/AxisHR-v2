          <h2>Clear Plan, Measurable Progress</h2>
          <p>AxisHR is implemented as an operating program, not a one-time setup. Teams start with high-risk workflows, confirm data quality, and then expand with control.</p>
          <ol class="steps compact-steps">
            <li><strong>Map the friction:</strong> identify where handoffs break across HR, managers, and finance.</li>
            <li><strong>Configure the flow:</strong> align approvals, policies, and permissions with your real structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Run with control:</strong> use dashboards and audit logs to keep execution accurate over time.</li>

        <h2>Why AxisHR Is Different In Daily Operations</h2>
        <p class="hero-lead">Every differentiator below is tied to a practical operational problem buyers face during growth.</p>
        <div class="grid grid-2">
          <article class="card">
            <h3>1. Multi-Branch Workforce Without Duplicate Records</h3>
            <p>AxisHR keeps one employee record across branch transfers and cross-branch assignments, so reporting and approvals stay accurate as teams move.</p>
            <ul class="list-check">
              <li>One employee can work across branches with full branch history.</li>
              <li>Hierarchy visibility supports head office, regional office, and branch management.</li>
              <li>Branch-level controls reduce reporting confusion and access mistakes.</li>
            </ul>
          </article>
          <article class="card">
            <h3>2. One Data Flow From Attendance To Payroll</h3>
            <p>Instead of rebuilding payroll data every cycle, AxisHR routes attendance, leave, claims, and approvals into payroll-ready inputs.</p>
            <ul class="list-check">
              <li>Approval logic is policy-driven and traceable.</li>
              <li>Payroll runs use cleaner, validated workforce data.</li>
              <li>Finance sees fewer manual corrections and disputes.</li>
            </ul>
          </article>
          <article class="card">
            <h3>3. Governance Built Into Daily Work</h3>
            <p>Security, role-based visibility, and audit trails are embedded in normal workflows, so compliance is maintained without extra manual checklists.</p>
            <ul class="list-check">
              <li>Field-level permissions and role scopes protect sensitive information.</li>
              <li>Every key edit and approval event is recorded for review.</li>
              <li>MFA-ready controls support stronger access governance.</li>
            </ul>
          </article>
          <article class="card">
            <h3>4. Phased Rollout With Continuous Improvement</h3>
            <p>AxisHR is designed for staged activation so teams can launch critical workflows first and expand without process rework.</p>
            <ul class="list-check">
              <li>Start with workforce data and payroll readiness.</li>
              <li>Add performance, engagement, and advanced reporting in sequence.</li>
              <li>Use KPI and audit reviews to improve execution after go-live.</li>

          <span class="kicker">The Core Problem</span>
          <h2>Disconnected Systems Turn Simple HR Tasks Into Risk</h2>
          <p>Most growing teams are not short on effort. They are short on shared data. Employee updates happen in one tool, attendance in another, payroll in spreadsheets, and every handoff adds risk.</p>
          <p>AxisHR creates one operational source of truth with role-based visibility. Managers get clear action queues, HR gets policy control, finance gets reliable payroll inputs, and leadership gets decision-grade reporting.</p>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>What Changes In The First 90 Days</h3>
          <ul class="list-check">
            <li>Employee records, branch assignments, and compensation changes stay synchronized.</li>
            <li>Attendance, leave, and claims approvals flow directly into payroll preparation.</li>
            <li>KPI-based performance cycles replace ad-hoc annual reviews.</li>
            <li>Survey and issue workflows surface risk earlier and improve follow-through.</li>
            <li>Audit trails make operational changes traceable and review-ready.</li>

          <details>
            <summary>Can we keep our current systems running during transition?</summary>
            <p>Yes. Most organizations run a phased transition where selected existing tools continue temporarily while high-risk workflows move first.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What should phase one include for lowest implementation risk?</summary>
            <p>Start with employee records, structure, permissions, attendance, leave routing, and approval ownership. This creates a stable foundation before broader expansion.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What internal team should be involved from day one?</summary>
            <p>A practical team usually includes an HR owner, payroll or finance owner, operations owner, and one implementation lead for policy decisions.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What data must be clean before migration starts?</summary>
            <p>Prioritize employee records, reporting structure, compensation-impacting fields, attendance rules, and leave balances to reduce downstream correction work.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How do we control manager access to sensitive payroll information?</summary>
            <p>Role and scope-based visibility allows managers to complete operational approvals while salary and sensitive fields remain restricted.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How does AxisHR support audit and compliance reviews?</summary>
            <p>Key access, approval, and change events are traceable, making it easier to retrieve evidence for governance checks and audit preparation.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How soon can managers and HR teams use it confidently?</summary>
            <p>Most teams see stable daily usage after core workflows are configured and owners are trained on approvals, exceptions, and action queues.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What results should we measure in the first six months?</summary>
            <p>Track approval turnaround time, exception volume, payroll correction rate, and manual effort removed from HR and finance workflows.</p>
