        <h1>Built For Teams Running Complex Workforce Operations</h1>
        <p class="hero-lead">AxisHR was built for organizations where branch structure, approvals, attendance, payroll inputs, and compliance evidence must stay connected every day.</p>

          <h2>Why We Built AxisHR</h2>
          <p>Many growing teams do not fail because they lack effort. They fail because employee data, attendance, leave, claims, and payroll preparation live in disconnected tools.</p>
          <p>AxisHR brings those workflows into one operating system with role-based access, policy routing, and traceable decision history.</p>

          <h3>What We Focus On</h3>
          <ul class="list-check">
            <li>Cleaner payroll inputs from upstream workflow discipline.</li>
            <li>Faster approvals with clear ownership and escalation paths.</li>
            <li>Governance controls that work in daily operations, not just audits.</li>
            <li>Practical rollout plans that teams can execute in phases.</li>
          </ul>
