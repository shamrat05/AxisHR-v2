        <h1>Built For The Operational Complexity Most HR Tools Ignore</h1>
        <p class="hero-lead">AxisHR is designed for organizations that must run branch operations, attendance, leave, payroll preparation, and governance as one connected system.</p>
      </div>

          <h2>Our Position</h2>
          <p>Most HR systems are easy to buy but difficult to operate once branch complexity, policy exceptions, and payroll dependencies start growing.</p>
          <p>AxisHR focuses on practical execution: cleaner data flow, controlled approvals, role-scoped visibility, and audit-ready records.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>How We Measure Value</h3>
          <ul class="list-check">
            <li>Fewer payroll corrections caused by upstream data issues.</li>
            <li>Faster approval cycle time across managers and HR.</li>
            <li>Stronger policy consistency across branches and entities.</li>
            <li>Better operational visibility for HR, finance, and leadership.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>1. Multi-Branch Logic Is Native, Not Layered On Later</h2>
          <p><strong>Why this is different:</strong> Many teams end up duplicating employee records when staff move across branches or take temporary assignments.</p>
          <p>AxisHR keeps one employee history across branch movement with hierarchy-aware approvals and reporting continuity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <ul class="list-check">
            <li>Single employee record across branch assignments.</li>
            <li>Branch history preserved for reporting and audits.</li>
            <li>Entity and branch scope supported in visibility controls.</li>
          </ul>

        <div>
          <h2>2. Payroll Readiness Starts Upstream</h2>
          <p><strong>Why this is different:</strong> Payroll errors are usually created before payroll starts, in attendance, leave, claims, and late approvals.</p>
          <p>AxisHR connects those workflows so approved data reaches payroll in a controlled and traceable way.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <ul class="list-check">
            <li>Attendance and leave approvals feed payroll preparation.</li>
            <li>Claims can follow governed approval and payout flow.</li>
            <li>Run-level traceability supports review and correction.</li>
          </ul>

        <div>
          <h2>3. Governance Is Embedded In Daily Work</h2>
          <p><strong>Why this is different:</strong> Governance often becomes a separate manual exercise that teams only revisit during audits.</p>
          <p>AxisHR embeds access control, approval evidence, and activity history into operational workflows so controls stay active by default.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <ul class="list-check">
            <li>Role and scope-based access across sensitive records.</li>
            <li>Audit logs for critical changes and approvals.</li>
            <li>MFA-ready and password-policy controls for stronger access governance.</li>
          </ul>

        <div>
          <h2>4. Rollout Is Structured For Adoption, Not Just Go-Live</h2>
          <p><strong>Why this is different:</strong> Large launches fail when every workflow is activated at once without ownership and checkpoints.</p>
          <p>AxisHR supports phased launch where teams stabilize high-risk workflows first, then expand with KPI and audit feedback.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <ul class="list-check">
            <li>Phase-wise rollout aligned to business risk and readiness.</li>
            <li>Clear ownership across HR, finance, operations, and managers.</li>
            <li>Post-launch optimization using measurable workflow outcomes.</li>
